Hi, my name is Jolo. I am currently a game development student residing in the Philippines. I mostly make games in Unity, but I also tend to check out other tech in my free time.

In this site, I plan to document the things I use and find interesting, as well as post stuff about my projects down the line.

Aside from game development, in my free time I play video games (obviously), read manga, watch vtubers, and learn more about tech both in hardware and software.
